### Project Title
Udacity Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project analyze the bike sharing data from the selected cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington. A terminal application is created, using Python modules - Pandas and NumPy to query the bike sharing data and give a set of summary statistics for each city.

### Details
The terminal application filters the data based on user input for the city, month and/or day for which the user would like to view the data.

  Following the input received, the application provides the following information:

* Most popular day of week
* Most popular hour of day
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular trip from start to end
* Total travel time
* Average travel time
* Counts of each user type
* Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* Earliest, Most recent, Most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

Raw data is displayed upon request by the user, the application prompts the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data.

### Requirements
* Language: Python 3.6 or above
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, time

### Files used
* <i>bikeshare.py</i>
* <i>chicago.csv</i>
* <i>new_york_city.csv</i>
* <i>washington.csv</i>

### Running program
1. Place the <i>bikeshare.py</i> file and all the <i>csv files</i> into the same folder
2. Run the python file (<i>bikeshare.py</i>) using a suitable python interpreter.
